## Research Interests

I’m interested in developing intelligent systems (**trustworthy AI**) that can demonstrate a deep understanding of the world with common-sense knowledge and reasoning ability by teaching machines to think, talk, and act as humans do. To this end, I am really interested in integrating techniques of _<u>information extraction</u>_, _<u>knowledge representation learning</u>_, _<u>graph-neural network</u>_, _<u>semantic parsing</u>_, etc. Besides, I am also interested in _<u>causal inference</u>_, _<u>interpretability and robustness of the ptms</u>_ and _<u>transfer learning</u>_ topics. 

## Education

## Activity
During my undergraduate period, I started a school-level robotics lab and recruited 30 like-minded lab members, and we did many interesting things together. For example, we organized an **"open day"** where we invited 20 elementary school students to the lab and by explaining some of the basics of robotics, we hoped to stimulate their interest and exploration of mechanical, computer and scientific problems; Also, we **hosted a reading festival** at the school library which is open to the whole campus. In this festival, We build a book recommendation system by voice recognition, image classification and some other technologies, and we use this system to recommend the prespective book list for the participates.
